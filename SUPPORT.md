## **nanoFramework** support

If you are having issues, need clarification on something or want to start a discussion about a relevant topic, instead of opening an issue it is best to start a conversation on one of our Slack channels. 
Please select the channel that's most appropriate to the context so subject matter experts are most likely to answer promptly.


You can join our lively Slack community by filling in this [invite form](https://nanoframework.wordpress.com/slack-invite-form/).


Please remember that the community members have their daily jobs and work on this project in their free time.
That is to say that you can always expect an answer. Maybe not instantly but - hopefully - in a timely fashion ðŸ˜‰ !
