# Using ARM Cortex-M Single Wire Output (SWO)


**About this document**

This document describes how to use Cortex-M SWO to output data from **nanoFramework**.


## Prerequisites

You'll need:
* Target board with SWO pin free _and_ configured in it's reset state (meaning not used by GPIO or any other peripheral and not configured in any alternate mode).
* If using a stock board it's also convenient to check the schematics if any hardware changes are required.
  * [STM F429I_DISCOVERY](../../images/STM32F429I-DISCOVERY-solder-bridge-for-swo.jpg) board requires solder bridge SB9 to be soldered
  * [STM F769I-DISCO](../../images/STM32F769I-DISCO-solder-bridge-for-swo.jpg) board requires a 0 Ohm resistor on R92 (or just soldering the pads toghether)
* Software capable of driving and outputting data from an SWO source. (ST-Link)[http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/development-tool-software/stsw-link004.html] is an excellent tool for this purpose.
* Set **nanoFramework** build options to include support for SWO (either setting `"SWO_OUTPUT" : "ON"` in cmake-variants.json or launching CMake with -DSWO_OUPUT=ON).


## Outputting SWO

1. Load the target flash with a **nanoFramework** image build with SWO option

2. On ST-Link menu choose ST-Link -> Printf via SWO viewer

3. After SWO viewer windows loads, set the Sytem clock to match the target and the Stimulus port to `0`.

4. Click the Start button and watch the output in the main window area.
