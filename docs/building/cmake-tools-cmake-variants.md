**About this document**

This document describes how to use and modify the **cmake-variants.TEMPLATE.json** file to suit your needs.

_Note : the current revision of the document only focuses on using ChibiOS RTOS. Other RTOSes will follow in a future revision._

## What is it

cmake-variants.TEMPLATE.json is a template containing a minimal set of configuration examples needed to build nanoFramework for you board.

Its content describes what kind of build you will get, which toolchain(s) you will use, which type of MCU is on the board, and some other options that will be described later in this document.

## How to use it

First, you have to either rename the file or copy the contents to **cmake-variants.json**. Then, you will have to modify the content to match your environment.


## Brief description

There are two sets of parameters that need to be present in this file :
- the build type : 'debug' or 'release', for example
- the board's environment : MCU, toolchain, RTOS

You should not have to modify the *BuildType* section unless you have good reasons to do so. However, the *Linkage* section is the one you will have to take care of.

For each *board* you want to build, you will have to create a dedicated section in the *Linkage* area, precisely describing the MCU, the toolchain, the build type and the RTOS you will use.

## Content explained
The following explains each line of the *linkage* section. Text highlighted in **bold** is an information that you will have to provide.

**_Note : Mind the forward slash ('/') in paths strings !_**

- "**OPTION1_NAME_HERE**"
	- Replace this text with a distinctive option name. e.g. *"STM32F429_Disco"*
- "oneWordSummary$": "**<summary-here>**"
	- Replace the *<summary-here>* text with one word describing shortly your board. e.g. "F429Disco"
- "description$": "**<description-here>**"
	- This is a more complete description of the configuration
- "TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX" : "**<path-to-gcc-toolchain-mind-the-forward-slash>**"
	- This is the path to your gcc toolchain compiler. Use forward slashes and do not provide executable name here
- "TARGET_CHIP" : "**<target-chip-with-official-vendor-reference>**"
	- For STM32 MCUs only : represents the complete official reference of the MCU
- "TARGET_SERIES" : "**STM32F7xx**"
	- For STM32 MCUs only : represents the target series (STM32F4XX, STM32L4XX, and so on)
- "USE_FPU" : "**TRUE**"
	- TRUE or FALSE : Enables or disables the use of the FPU unit, if present.
- "RTOS" : "**<one-of-valid-rtos-options>**"
	- Defines the RTOS that will be used to build nanoFramework. It can be CHIBIOS, FREERTOS or MBEDOS. Currently, only CHIBIOS is supported.
- "CHIBIOS_SOURCE" : "**<path-to-chibios-source-mind-the-forward-slash>**"
	- Path to an optional local installation of ChibiOS source files. If no path is given, then CMake will download the sources from the projects ChibiOS repository when needed
- "CHIBIOS_VERSION" : "**<N.N.N>**"
	- Version of the local/distant distribution of ChibiOS that will be used. If no version is provided, CMake will use the master branch.
- "CHIBIOS_BOARD" : "**<valid-chibios-board-name-from-boards-collection>**"
	- Name of your board, chosen from the available boards collection that can be found in the \os\hal\boards folder of the ChibiOS installation (or distant repository)
- "SWO_OUTPUT" : "**<OFF-default-ON-to-enable-ARM-CortexM-Single-Wire-Output**"
	- Allows specifying whether to include, or not, support for Cortex-M Single Wire Output (SWO). Check the documentation [here](arm-swo.md) for more details on how to use SWO.
- "NF_FEATURE_DEBUGGER" : "**<TRUE-to-include-nF-debugger>**"
	- A boolean switch to specify whether the debugger feature is to be included.
- "NF_FEATURE_RTC" : "**<OFF-default-ON-to-enable-hardware-RTC>**"
	- Allows you to specify whether the board contains a real time clock that can be used for date & time functions.
- "NF_FEATURE_USE_NETWORKING" : "**<OFF-default-ON-to-enable-networking>**"
	- Allows you to specify whether to include the TCP/IP stack.
- "NF_FEATURE_USE_APPDOMAINS" : "**<OFF-default-ON-to-enable-support-for-Application-Domains>**"
	- Allows you to specify whether to include, or not, support for Application Domains. More information about this is available in the documentation [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cxk374d9(v=vs.90).aspx). ***Note that the complete removal of support for this feature is being considered (see issue [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter/issues/303)).***
- "API_Windows.Devices.Gpio" : "**<OFF-default-ON-to-add-this-API>**"
	- Allows you to specify whether GPIO functions are available to your application.
- "FREERTOS_VERSION" : "**<N.N.N>**"
	- Version of the local/distant distribution of FREERTOS that will be used
- "FREERTOS_SOURCE" : "**<path-to-freertos-source-mind-the-forward-slash>**"
	- Path to an optional local installation of FREERTOS source files. If no path is given, then CMake will download the sources from the official repository when needed
- "MBEDOS_SOURCE" : "**<path-to-mbedos-source-mind-the-forward-slash>**"
	- Path to an optional local installation of MBEDOS source files. If no path is given, then CMake will download the sources from the official repository when needed
- "MBED_TARGET" : "**<valid-target-name-from-targets-json-file>**"
	- ????

## Working example
The following linkage section is a real example used to build nanoFramework for the MBN Quail board. It is using the minimal mandatory information :

```
"MBNQUAIL":
	{
		"oneWordSummary$": "QUAIL",
        "description$": "MBN Quail",
        "settings":
		{
            "TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX" : "C:/Program Files (x86)/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/5.4 2016q3",
            "TARGET_CHIP" : "STM32F427VIT",
			"TARGET_SERIES" : "STM32F4xx",
            "USE_FPU" : "TRUE",
            "RTOS" : "CHIBIOS", 
            "CHIBIOS_VERSION" : "16.1.7",
            "CHIBIOS_SOURCE" : "C:/dev/ChibiOS_16.1.7",
            "CHIBIOS_BOARD" : "MBN_QUAIL"
			"NF_FEATURE_DEBUGGER" : "TRUE",
            "NF_FEATURE_RTC" : "ON",
			"NF_FEATURE_USE_APPDOMAINS" : "OFF",
			"NF_FEATURE_USE_NETWORKING" : "OFF",			
            "API_Windows.Devices.Gpio" : "ON"
        },
        "buildType": "Debug"
      },
```
