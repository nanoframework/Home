# **nanoFramework** Home

This _Home_ repository is the starting point for developers that want to learn about **nanoFramework**, contribute to it or opening issues.
It contains links to the various GitHub repositories used by **nanoFramework**.

**nanoFramework** goal is to be a platform that enables the writing of managed code applications for constrained embedded devices. 
Developers can harness the familiar IDE Visual Studio and their .NET (C#) knowledge to quickly write applications without having to worry about the low level hardware intricacies of a micro-controller.

Being a developer you'll probably will fit in one (or maybe both :wink:) of the following _profiles_:
- Developer: if your goal is to develop C# applications for micro-controllers.
- Contributor: if you are interested in actively contributing by coding (native, managed, C, C++, CMake), writing documentation or participating in the overall project organization.


## Firmware for reference boards


Each of the following ZIP files contains the image files for nanoBooter and nanoCLR in various formats (HEX, BIN and DFU). They should be flashed in the target boards using an appropriate software utility.

The **stable** versions are RTM builds with the smallest possible size. They include the latest stable version. The debugging feature is disabled and only minimal (or none) error messages.

The **preview** versions are continuous builds of the reference targets. They include the latest version of all features and bug corrections. They also have the debugging feature enabled along with detailed error messages.

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, and join in design conversations. 
If you are having issues or need a clarification about something, instead of opening an issue the best way is to start a conversation in one of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gCyBu8T) channels.
Please select the one that's most appropriate to the matter you are facing.

If you've find a bug or can't use Discord, please open an issue at [Issues](https://github.com/nanoframework/Home/issues).
We ask you to open an issue only when you have a real and confirmed one. Don't open an issue for support requests or to start a discussion. For that you'll get a better (and quicker!) support/feedback in one of the [Discord](https://discord.gg/gCyBu8T) channels.

Looking for something to work on? Check the list of [up-for-grabs issues](https://github.com/nanoframework/Home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs) on the Home repo, that's a great place to start.

## Documentation

### [Docs](docs/)

The project documentation is a great place to find information about **nanoFramework**, no matter if you are newcomer or a veteran. It's organized in the following categories:
- [API reference](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api) documentation for the various class libraries.
- [Developing C# applications](docs/developing-apps) using **nanoFramework**.
- [Building an image](docs/building) to load on a target board.
- [**nanoFramework** architecture](docs/architecture/) and how the different pieces fit together.
- [Contributing to **nanoFramework**](docs/contributing/) includes an overview on how you can contribute to the project. 


### [Blog](http://www.nanoframework.net/blog)

There is a blog where we try to post detailed updates about the development status, technical posts about a particular feature ou a design option.


## Who is behind this project?

There are a number of people behind this project. We are mostly embedded systems enthusiasts, passionate about coding and people that like challenges.
